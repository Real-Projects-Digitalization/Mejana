# Mejana - Your daily safety companion

**MEJANA** is a mobile app specifically designed to protect people in their everyday lives through comprehensive safety features. It offers a range of primarily AI-based features aimed at protecting users in moments of danger and uncertainty, providing quick assistance and sharing safety information.

## UI / UX / DESIGN
The application is primarily controlled and operated using voice control. The main functions can also be operated using the touch screen.
The design is simple but futuristic and pretentious. The support of artificial intelligence should be evident at all times.

## Features
The features that are supported and developed further by artificial intelligence play a central role. It is possible to speak to the AI, whose name is MEJANA, at any time. It can give valuable advice on behavior and automatically recognizes dangerous situations. In the event of such a situation, MEJANA initially reports by vibrating the smartphone and emitting an acoustic signal. Later on, for example, the SOS function can be activated automatically, with the location being transmitted to rescue services. In addition to the location, a short description of the situation is provided.


- **Real-time GPS location tracking and transmission**
  
It is possible to share your own location with people from the contact list. The location is recorded at all times so that it can be transmitted in an emergency. It creates individual behavior and movement patterns that the AI ​​evaluates. As the number of users increases, location tracking is becoming increasingly capable of minimizing risks based on probabilities through artificial intelligence - it makes use of the network effect.

- **SOS function**
  
MEJANA can automatically detect emergencies and also differentiate between different types of emergencies. The smartphone's sensors and the acoustic transmitter are used for this purpose. In conjunction with artificial intelligence, a decision is made by the AI. When an emergency call is sent, brief information about the situation and the exact location are also provided. Other users of the app are warned at the same time if they are in the immediate vicinity.

- **conversation with the AI called MEJANA**
  
MEJANA listens to voice commands of all kinds and can also confidently answer complex questions. For example, when traveling abroad, it can provide precise instructions on what to do and warn of possible dangers. It is primarily trained to answer questions that relate to safety, but can answer any sensible questions. MEJANA is therefore an intelligent companion in everyday life that can provide advice on safety aspects.

- **supply of specific information**
  
Specific information is provided. Important information such as warnings is displayed directly and its effect can be enhanced by acoustics and vibrations. The information can be in the form of advice, recommendations, warnings or even reassuring. MEJANA prioritizes the information provided independently.
