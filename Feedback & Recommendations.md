# Recommendations:
- Dive deeper into problem fields and try to shape it!
- Too generic at the moment > Direction after interviews
- „What is actually relevant for majority of people”
- Compare to market opponents like apple > strong competition
- Define untackled problems

- Restructure Interview questions --> cluster
- Justin Wilcox customer discovery

## Concerning the mid-term-presentation
- focus on safety issues
- well-being and healt probalbly don't fit that well
- conduct interviews again
- more specific focus into safety issus
- what safety features are customers willing to pay for
