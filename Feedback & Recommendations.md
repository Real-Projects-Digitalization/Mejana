# Recommendations:
- Dive deeper into problem fields and try to shape it!
- Too generic at the moment > Direction after interviews
- „What is actually relevant for majority of people”
- Compare to market opponents like apple > strong competition
- Define untackled problems

- Restructure Interview questions --> cluster
- Justin Wilcox customer discovery
